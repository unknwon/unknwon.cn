- 是否有过与分布式团队协作的经历？体验怎么样？即使不是真正意义上的远程办公，也可以举一些在旅行中或者是和不同地区的同事、同学完成某个项目的例子。
- 为了确保能够在远程环境下进行有效的沟通，你都尝试过哪些方法或者实践？

- 如果你发现需要获得某位同事的协作才能完成某项工作，但这位同事生活在另一个时区且此刻并不在线，你会怎么做？

## 远程岗位定制

**学习目标：理解分布式职工群体的招聘和入职流程上的不同**

在团队转型到完全的远程环境过程中，团队成员的组成也会随之变化。这里列出一些在构建远程团队时会遇到的变更。

首先，就是你的人力资源团队 — 负责 HR、招聘、入职和行政等等的人员大概率都会增加。主要原因可能是因为需要覆盖多个地区的工作，但是一般来说，在非传统办公室环境下成员会需要更多企业方面的支持和信息提供。此外，远程办公打破并颠覆了许多关于传统人力资源管理的期望。

**IT operations** and **business operations** can also grow in size. More time and thought will go into planning, provisioning, controlling, and managing access to tools, data, and systems. Security training will require intense focus. In remote work, there’s more demand and need for strong business metrics. Expect to add seats and roles on these teams to support increased activity.

Meanwhile, some areas of your team may be diminished. Most obviously, you won’t require **physical security** and **maintenance** in office buildings. But you can also expect to reduce in some areas of management: namely, roles that are focused on **employee monitoring**. In remote work, it’s neither possible nor advisable to monitor attendance and activity. As we’ll discuss later in this course, the focus should be on results and outcomes. Developing a culture of trust also means avoiding micromanagement and monitoring.

Finally, what about hybrid-remote teams where some people are in an office and others are not? While we don’t advise this model, if you do decide to implement it, take care to ensure that all members of a single team unit are either all-remote or all-colocated. If team members have a unified experience, it helps prevent some of the dissatisfaction that can arise from hybrid-remote structures.

# Lesson 3: Work Environment

- Ability to focus
  - Designated space with a door that can close
  - Decent noise control

### Additional Considerations for People and HR Best Practices

**Learning Objective: Understand how hiring and onboarding differ for a distributed workforce.**

The essential functions of supporting a multinational team do not change when that team is working remotely, but some of the details do. If you’re transitioning from a colocated or in-office environment to a distributed one, there are many subtle shifts in tactics you’ll need to facilitate.

Here are just a few of the things to consider as you’re planning your recruiting, hiring, and onboarding processes. We'll cover each of these areas in greater detail throughout this course.

**Transparency is vital**

In a remote, global workspace, sharing information transparently is essential to good communication, operations, inclusivity, culture, and more. Team members at all levels should be able to see how work happens and problems are solved. At GitLab, we are transparent by default. Work happens in issues that are visible to all team members, and conversations are directed to open chat channels where anyone can drop in and participate.

The most obvious benefit here is communication, which we’ll discuss in more detail shortly, but there are lesser-known benefits to transparency. As an example, a leader posting their vacation schedule and delegating their work doesn’t just help their team know where to access information in the leader’s absence. It also models expected behavior, encourages team members to take time off, and empowers individuals. Or as another example, an employee seeking career advancement should be able to access information on how promotions work, and to observe who is being promoted and why.

**Time zones and meetings**

Scheduling calls can quickly become a challenge for global teams. Have a set of practices around this. GitLab records video of most team calls so that anyone who can’t attend live can still review the recording. However, every team member should have a weekly 1:1 meeting with their supervisor. This is an important opportunity for synchronous problem solving, but it also creates a space for informal chat and relationship building.

Some remote teams have enforced or de facto work hours, while others are on asynchronous 24/7 schedules. Encode these expectations in your handbook, and have a plan for how you will communicate expectations around work schedules. Remember that you can’t, and shouldn’t, monitor attendance. Later in this course, we’ll discuss using results as a metric rather than hours worked.

**Benefits and rewards**

Benefits of remote work can vary greatly from person to person. For many, there are intangible lifestyle benefits, such as the lack of a commute and a flexible schedule. This doesn’t mean you should cut back on formal benefits, however. As discussed previously, there are specific benefits you should consider adding to a traditional package: office equipment or workspace, and mental health benefits. [Here's how GitLab handles benefits](https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/benefits).

Having a [dedicated, safe, ergonomic and effective workspace](https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/workspace) is essential for every worker. In remote work, you can’t predict what people’s home environments will be. The best practice is to offer whatever they need: furniture, equipment, tools, or even a coworking membership if they prefer. Make it clear that this is all expensable, with a reasonable cap on cost. For example, GitLab team members may spend up to $5,000 on their home office without needing expense approval. We offer a list of recommendations for equipment, but allow individuals to purchase what they believe they need.

Also offer a mental wellness support plan, such as a counseling benefit. [Burnout and loneliness](https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/mental-health) are risks of remote work, and the best way to support people who are experiencing burnout is to prepare them with knowledge on how to treat it. Let people know that confidential support is available, and inform them on how to access it, well before it could be needed.

**HR tech stack**

Your People team will need to employ a wide range of tools and services in order to do their jobs effectively. Here's a guide to [the tools GitLab uses throughout our organization](https://learn.gitlab.com/coursera-remote-work/tech-stack). Remote work is new, and no single tool or service will cover all needs. However, using untested services can lead to serious security risks. Work closely with your IT team to vet and safely set up the best tools for your needs, and conduct regular audits of personal data and safety. In a distributed environment, be aware that you’ll need to set aside some time simply for tech administration. Make time for this crucial process.
